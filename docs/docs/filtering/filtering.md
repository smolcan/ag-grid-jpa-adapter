# Filtering

We support two types of filtering:

### [Column Filter](column-filter)
Filtering on a specific column, allowing users to filter data based on values in that column.

### [Advanced Filter](advanced-filter)
An advanced filter builder that enables more complex filtering conditions across multiple columns.
