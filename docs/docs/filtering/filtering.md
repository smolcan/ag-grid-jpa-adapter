# Filtering

We support 4 types of filtering:

### [Column Filter](./column-filter/column-filter.md)
Filtering on a specific column, allowing users to filter data based on values in that column.

### [Advanced Filter](./advanced-filter/advanced-filter.md)
An advanced filter builder that enables more complex filtering conditions across multiple columns.

### [External Filter](./external-filter.md)
An application filter that is independent of any filtering done within the grid.

### [Quick Filter](./quick-filter.md)
A text-based filter that filters rows across all columns and words in the text.
