 * Metadata wrapper for a JPA {@link Selection}, used during dynamic query construction and analysis.
 * <p>
 * This class captures the role of a selection within a query â€” for example, whether it is part of 
 * grouping, pivoting, or aggregation. It also enables reuse of previously defined selection expressions 
 * for operations like filtering and ordering, avoiding redundant creation and ensuring consistency 
 * across the query lifecycle.
